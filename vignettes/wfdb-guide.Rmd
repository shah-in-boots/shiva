The package relies and is augmented heavily by the [Waveform Database (WFDB) software package](https://physionet.org/content/wfdb/10.7.0/), which is a well-documented and well-developed ecosystem of software applications, primarily written in `C` and `C++` that manage the storage, reading, writing, and interaction with electrical signal data.
This software is mostly external to the `{EGM}` package, and is used to supplement and expand the software.

__DISCLAIMER__: The software required to use annotations has not yet been re-written into a `C` backend for `R`, and thus requires using a local installation of `WFDB` for functionality. 
To build online vignettes and articles, where the software package is not available, I only demonstrate non-running examples.

# Installation

To install the `WFDB` software in its traditional, `C`-based format, I have found it easiest with teh instructions from the [Github](https://github.com/bemoody/wfdb) source. 
The installation instructions are relatively clear across multiple operating systems.

`WFDB` is easiest to install on a Unix-based system, such as Linux or MacOS. 
For Windows, I have found that using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is the most consistent and supported way to utilize the software.
When hidden on WSL, the path must be specified explicitly using the `set_wfdb_path()` function using the command from Powershell, for example, to switch to a WSL command environment.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set_wfdb_path("wsl /usr/local/bin")
```

Once this is in place, you should be able to work with `WFDB` files directly from `R` without significant overhead costs, while also gaining access to a variety of software applications.

# Annotations

The WFDB software package utilizes a binary format to store annotations.
Annotations are essentially markers or qualifiers of specific components of a signal, specifying both the specific time or position in the plot, and what channel the annotation refers to. 
Annotations are polymorphic, and multiple can be applied to a single signal dataset. 
The credit for this work goes directly to the original software creators, as this is just a wrapper to allow for flexible integration into `R`. 

To begin, let's take an example of a simple ECG dataset.
This data is included in the package, and can be accessed as below.

```{r}
fp <- system.file('extdata', 'muse-sinus.xml', package = 'EGM')
ecg <- read_muse(fp)
fig <- ggm(ecg) + theme_egm_light()
fig
```

We may have customized software, manual approaches, or machine learning models that may label signal data.
We can use the `annotation_table()` function to create `WFDB`-compatible annotations, updating both the `egm` object and the written file.
To trial this, let's label the peaks of the QRS complex from this 12-lead ECG.

1. Create a quick, non-robust function for labeling QRS complex peaks. The function `pracma::findpeaks()` is quite good, but to avoid dependencies we are writing our own.
1. Evaluate the fit of the peaks to the dataset
1. Place the annotations into a table, updating the `egm` object
1. Plot the results

```{r}
# Let x = 10-second signal dataset
# We will apply this across the dataset
# This is an oversimplified approach.
find_peaks <- function(x,
                       threshold = 
                         mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) + 2 * sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
                       ) {
  
  # Ensure signal is "positive" for peak finding algorithm
  x <- abs(x)
  
  # Find the peaks
  peaks <- which(diff(sign(diff(x))) == -2) + 1
  
  # Filter the peaks
  peaks <- peaks[x[peaks] > threshold]
  
  # Return
  peaks
}

# Create a signal dataset
dat <- extract_signal(ecg)

# Find the peaks
sig <- dat[["I"]]
pk_loc <- find_peaks(sig)
pk_val <- sig[pk_loc]
pks <- data.frame(x = pk_loc, y = pk_val)

# Plot them
plot(sig, type = "l")
points(x = pks$x, y = pks$y, col = "orange")
```

The result is *not bad* for a simple peak finder, but it lets us generate a small dataset of annotations that can then be used.
Please see the additional vignettes for advanced annotation options, such as multichannel plots, and multichannel annotations.
We can take a look under the hood at the annotation positions we generated.
The relevant arguments, which are displayed below, include:

- annotator: name of annotation function or creator
- time: constructed from sample number and frequency
- sample: integer index of positions
- type: a single character describing the type
- subtype: a single character describing the type
- channel: which channel the data is mapped to
- number: an additional qualifier of the annotation type

```{r}
# Find the peaks
raw_signal <- dat[["I"]]
peak_positions <- find_peaks(raw_signal)
peak_positions

# Annotations do not need to store the value at that time point however
# The annotation table function has the following arguments
args(annotation_table)

# We can fill this in as below using additional data from the original ECG
hea <- ecg$header
start <- attributes(hea)$record_line$start_time
hz <- attributes(hea)$record_line$frequency

ann <- annotation_table(
  annotator = "pks",
  time = peak_positions / hz,
  sample = peak_positions,
  type = vector(mode = "character", length = length(peak_positions)),
  subtype = vector(mode = "character", length = length(peak_positions)),
  channel = "I",
  number = vector(mode = "integer", length = length(peak_positions))
)

# Then, add this back to the original signal
ecg$annotation <- ann
ecg
```
