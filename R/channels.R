#' Add color scheme to a `ggm` object
#'
#' @description Using `add_colors()` is part of the theme process for a `ggm`
#'   object, which in turn is a visual representation of an `egm` object. Often,
#'   the `egm` dataset will contain default colors based on where the signal
#'   data was brought in from. `add_colors()` can allow customization of those
#'   features to some degree based on *opinionated* color palettes.
#'
#' @details Currently, the color choices are individual decided based on the
#'   channel source (e.g. lead) and are inspired by some modern palettes. The
#'   eventual goal for this function is to accept a multitude of palette options
#'   using heuristics similar to what is found in `{ggplot2}` or other graphing
#'   packages.
